class Classifier(Task):
    """Represents a binary classifiers that uses GPT to make predictions.

    When creating an instance of this class, you simply provide some instruction in natural language and optionally
    some examples of positive and negative cases.

    You can then use an instance of this class like a regular function to make predictions :
    If you have a class instance named `classifier`, calling `classifier(case)` will return either `True` or `False`
    depending on the prediction.

    When you make suche a call, the `case` argument you pass to the instance will be used together with the instruction
    and the examples given on initialization to build a prompt that will be sent to GPT. The response from GPT will
    then be used to make a prediction.

    This class expects the cases to be strings and will send them as-is to GPT. If you want your classification cases
    to be something else than a single string, you can optionally create a subclass of this class and override the
    `convert_case_to_gpt_message` method. This method will be used to preprocess the cases before sending them to GPT.

    This class is built on top of the `Task` class. See the documentation of `Task` for more details about the
    inner workings of this class.
